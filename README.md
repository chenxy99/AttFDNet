Attentive Few-Shot Object Detection Network (AttFDNet)
=====================================

This code implements the Attentive Few-Shot Object Detection Network (AttFDNet)

Disclaimer
------------------
We adopt the official implementation of the [`RFBNet`](https://github.com/ruinmessi/RFBNet) as a baseline model for few-shot object detection. We also use the [`Boolean Map Saliency algorithm`](https://github.com/fzliu/saliency-bms) to extract human saliency result of given an image. Please refer to these links for further README information.

Requirements
------------------
1. Requirements for Pytorch. We use Pytorch 0.4.1 in our experiments.
2. Python 3.6+
